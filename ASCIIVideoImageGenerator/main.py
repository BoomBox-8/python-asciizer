'''
• A program that converts images to an ASCII Art styled image! 
• Works on ALMOST all resolutions, 1280x720p images reccomended!
• Effect works best on images with a lot of 'variance' in contrast, ie, a picture consisting of
  smoothly blended colors or more or less the same few colors in its color pallete won't work well enough
• Test images are included in the folder for use, try them out!
No programmers were harmed in the making of this!
